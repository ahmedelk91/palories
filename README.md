Palories 1.0

This project was built utilizing the following technologies:

- Ruby on Rails
- HTML5/CSS3
- BootStrap framework for CSS

My approach was to make a calorie counting app for those new to fitness and healthier lifestyles. Palories assumes the user does not know much about proper nutrition. While most calorie counting apps will have a large database full of various food items, Palories provides the user with a helpful chart separating foods into 3 categories: Green (healthiest), Yellow (good options), and Red (unhealthy, bad options). The chart further break down serving size and calories into ballpark figures so not much thinking has to be involved. Finally, all calories in a given day are added from meals entered by the user and calculated to see which "color" takes precedence in their diet. On the index, the users calories are displayed and a color is assigned to give the user a sense of how their diet went for that day. The ethos behind "Palories" is that calories shouldn't be an intimidating calculation. Calories should be your Pal! Get it?

A few problems persist with Palories in its current version:

- An empty meal appears in every day. I was unable to remove it in time for this presentation.

- The user is unable to directly edit meals, and instead have to delete meals completely.

- I would like to add a section of the form in which the user can label their meals in terms of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.

- I would prefer if the chart were more interactive and gave users the ability to click on an example item to preload the meal form.
